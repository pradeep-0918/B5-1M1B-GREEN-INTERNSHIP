# 🌍 Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit Marketplace Prototype  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of my **internship with the 1M1B (One Million for One Billion) Foundation**, a United Nations–recognised initiative that empowers youth to solve real-world challenges through innovation and social entrepreneurship.  

### ❓ Problem Statement  
Small businesses and community groups often take up sustainability actions such as **tree planting, solar panel installation, recycling, and energy efficiency upgrades**. However, they struggle to **monetise their efforts** due to the absence of a **trusted and transparent system** for issuing and trading carbon credits.  

### 💡 Solution  
This prototype introduces a **blockchain-based carbon credit marketplace** that ensures transparency and trust in carbon credit trading.  

**Key Features:**  
- 🔗 **Blockchain (Hyperledger/Ethereum testnet):** Smart contracts for issuing, transferring, and retiring carbon credits.  
- 🤖 **AI Verification (scikit-learn):** A simple classifier to validate sustainability actions (e.g., image recognition for tree planting).  
- 🎨 **UI/UX (Figma):** A clickable prototype simulating the user experience of buying/selling credits.  
- 📊 **Dashboard (Tableau):** Visualizes verified green actions, credits issued, CO₂ offsets, and trading trends.
